            "abstract": "<p>In the operational management of railway networks, an important requirement is the fast adaptation of timetable scenarios, in which operational disruptions or time windows with temporary unavailability of infrastructure, for instance during maintenance time windows, are taken into consideration. In those situations, easy and fast reconfiguration and recalculation of timetable data is of central importance. This local and temporal rescheduling results in shifted departure and arrival times and sometimes even in modified stop patterns at intermediate stations of train runs. In order to generate reliable timetabling results it is a prerequisite that train-track assignments, as well as operational and commercial dependencies are taken into consideration. In order to refer to the right level of detail for modelling track infrastructure and train dynamics in the computer aided planning process we present a generic model that we call Track-Choice FPESP (TCFPESP), as it implements suitable extensions of the established PESP-model. We show, how the service intention (the data structure for timetable specification) together with resource capacity information entered into a standard timetabling tool like Viriato can be utilized in order to configure the TCFPESP model. \nIn addition, we are able to calculate quantitative performance measures for assessing timetable quality aspects. In order to achieve this we present a method for evaluating travel times based on passenger routings and a method for evaluating timetable robustness based on max-plus algebra. \nThis approach supports the planner to generate integrated periodic timetable solutions in iterative development cycles and taking into account intervals for local maintenance work.</p>",

In this study, historical disruption records of some Chinese High-Speed Railways (HSRs) lines from 2014\u20132016 were used to investigate the distribution characteristics of railway disruptions. The spatiotemporal probability distribution of four railway lines were calculated and their hotspots (coordinates with high probabilities) and coldspots (coordinates with low probabilities) were revealed using heatmaps. Furthermore, all the disruptions were classified into seven clusters based on their causes, and statistical analysis was carried out on each cluster. In addition, three right-skewed distribution models, namely Log-normal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions, were used to fit the duration of each cluster to uncover its duration regularities. Finally, goodness-of-fit test was performed on the models using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method, indicating that the duration of each classified disruption can be estimated using a Log-normal distribution function. The obtained spatiotemporal probabilities and duration time distribution models thus can be further applied into estimating the occurrence and duration of railway disruption in real-time dispatching to help dispatchers make advanced decisions.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Train crews are a considerable expense for North American freight railways. Unlike many railway operations in Europe and other countries, freight railways in the United States must operate mainline trains with two-person crews (engineer and conductor).  Besides human factors and safety concerns, the need for two crew members to perform work events en route, such as serving mainline customers, presents an obstacle to reducing labour costs by adopting single-person crews.  To overcome this obstacle, railroads have proposed to operate each train with a single-person crew and replace the on-board conductors with \u201croaming conductors\u201d who travel in highway vehicles and assist different trains with work events. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of replacing conventional on-board conductors with roaming conductors by solving the problem of optimally assigning train work events to roaming conductors. Various routing and scheduling approaches are developed to minimize the number of roaming conductors for a given operating plan. The results of Monte Carlo simulations show that based on different performance standards and practical assumptions in model parameters, the total number of roaming conductors will be less than the number of on-board conductors required for two-person crews. Depending on the operating conditions, roaming conductors can facilitate a net decrease in operating personnel (and associated decrease in labour costs) while still executing all required freight train work events.  The scheduling algorithms developed through this research can help railroad practitioners determine where roaming conductors may be a feasible alternative to two-person crews.</p>",

According to our knowledge, there are several issues with the SP method for obtaining VoR, for example, its deficiency in harmonizing the stated choices with the actual choices. On the other hand, Revealed Preference (RP) data from ticket sales has its limit in socioeconomic information of travellers and scenario variation. This project aimed to use a RP method to estimate VoR from several selected railway corridors, with Bayesian posterior analysis to infer socioeconomic differences between passengers given on their actual choices. </p>\n<p>The data in the study are from two sources, ticket sales data from a major passenger operator SJ, and data on train movements from Trafikverket\u2019s (Swedish Transportation administration) TF\u00d6R database. Both data sources are for the whole year 2009. The data includes 60 545 individual observations on traveler\u2019s route choice for two specific trip relations. The chosen trip relations are long-distance non-commuting trips with travel distances between 200 and 250 kilometers.</p>\n<p>The project is a \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d for possible use of ticket sales data for the estimation of VoR. We can conclude that the estimated VoR \u2013 1,13 times value of travel time, is in compliance with results from previous international studies using SP and/or RP data. The simulated distribution of VoR from posterior analysis also clearly indicates a bimodal pattern of valuing travel reliability, probably due to socio-economic characteristics or trip purposes.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>As the largest single source of freight rail revenue, intermodal transportation of shipping containers and highway trailers by rail currently accounts for over one half of the total carloads hauled by Class 1 railroads in North America.  A growing demand for freight transportation, along with record levels of North American intermodal rail traffic, has strained the capacity of the intermodal terminals dedicated to transloading containers and trailers to and from the rail mode.  Since intermodal terminal capital and operating costs are substantial and greatly influence the competitiveness of intermodal by rail relative to other modes, railroads desire to optimize the utilization and capacity of existing facilities before investing in new construction.  Although intermodal terminal capacity depends on a number of interrelated factors, current approaches to estimate intermodal terminal capacity rely on a combination of practitioner experience, historical trends and a limited number of single-factor capacity relationships. To provide industry practitioners with a better understanding of intermodal terminal capacity, this research investigates relationships between various capacity factors and intermodal terminal characteristics via simulation.  A simulation model of a domestic inland intermodal terminal is developed using AnyLogic\u00ae software and used to test different facility layouts and operating scenarios.  Preliminary results suggest that additional factors and interactions not considered by current capacity approaches may constrain intermodal terminal capacity and create congestion during periods of peak demand.  It is anticipated that the final results will provide practitioners with new relationships to better evaluate the capacity of existing and proposed intermodal terminals.</p>",

The existing studies are not deep enough in uncertain-demand network-level train timetabling problem. Furthermore, the most studies concentrated on the passengers\u2019 cost and neglected the operation companies\u2019 cost. This study proposes two mixed-integer linear multi-objective models under uncertain demand in rail transit network. The first one is on line level and the second one is on network level. Based on the perspective of both passengers and operation companies, the objective function is expressed as the weighted summation of average waiting time, final retention ratio and train services\u2019 quantity. The uncertainty of train services quantity, the restriction of train services capacity and the transfer behaviour between lines are also taken into account. A scenario-based stochastic programing approach is applied to handle the models, which takes the passenger demand in a number of random selected days as a set of scenarios. A case study is presented to testify the effectiveness of the models and the efficiency of the approach. The results show a decline in general objectives during the multiple planning days. It suggests that the proposed models can keep balance between service quality and service cost in the long-term practice.</p>",

Examples from structuring, processing and analysis of radar measurements, smart card data, GPS data and mobile phone operator data are given, and insights from analyses where the data is combined with digital map data and time table information are shown. The examples cover both applications where insights are generated directly from the data and applications where the data is used as input to traffic operations and traffic planning models.</p>",

Pre-planned train dispatching instructions for a specific disruption situation facilitate the work of the dispatchers. Those instructions are mostly manually designed and often focus solely on the train runs. The proposed approach aims to improve the quality of disruption programs concerning operations and especially concerning the reduced passenger mobility. For this purpose, the algorithms to be presented evaluate the operating concept on its functionality and reachability in a solely train operations focused way. A stable and fast transitioning disruption program is already enhancing the passenger mobility in a disruption, but it is not enough to call it passenger-friendly. For this purpose, the algorithms design a transportation concept including passenger guidance measures and comprise a final evaluation of the disruption program in a passenger-oriented way.</p>",

This data has the potential to contain erroneous or missing values, especially given its size and dimensionality. In this work a data reconciliation problem for rail dispatch data is proposed to identify and correct errors, as well as to impute missing data. The data reconciliation problem finds the least-perturbed modification of the historical data that satisfies operational constraints, such as feasibility of meet and overtake events, safety headway, siding allocation, and running time. It also imputes missing values with estimates that satisfy all operational constraints. The data reconciliation method is applied to a large historical dataset from freight rail territory in Tennessee, United States, containing over 3,000 train records over six months. The method identifies and corrects errors in the historical data, and is able to impute data on a synthetically decimated version of the historical data.  The quality of the imputed data from data reconciliation is compared to imputed data using naive interpolation. The results show that data reconciliation reduces timing error of imputed points by up to 15% and increases the number of meet and overtake events estimated at the correct historical location from less than 40% to approximately 95%. These findings indicate that the data reconciliation method is a useful preprocessing step for analysis and modeling of railroad operations that are based on real-world physical dispatching data.</p>",

In both cities, small dwell time delays of at most five minutes make up around 90% of the total delays. Therefore, it is valuable to understand and deal with these disturbances. To this end, we use high resolution data on dwell times and passenger counts from both countries over the last several years. We find that these data alone can explain about 40% of the variation in dwell time delays and produce simple models which can be used in practice to assign more appropriate dwell times. A change in the congestion rate of 10%, or 15 passengers per car, in Tokyo translates to a delay of about one second. For every 10 remaining passengers per car in Stockholm, the delay increases by about one second, and one boarding or alighting passenger per car corresponds to about 0.4 seconds of delay. We also find that trains in Tokyo are much more congested than in Sweden, and that at most stations in the latter, the exchange of passengers is quite small. In both cities, the range of dwell time delays is quite narrow, with between 40 and 50 seconds separating the 5th and 95th percentiles. This indicates further that most delays, by far, are very small, and that even small adjustments to dwell times can make a big difference in the overall picture. To facilitate such improvements, key stakeholders and practitioners are closely involved with the research.</p>",

The main optimization issue refers to finding a balance between the number of sorting steps and the total number of wagon movements. The optimization of the classification schedule could be addressed at different levels of the yard planning hierarchy. In this paper we develop mathematical formulation and two different heuristic algorithms to support tactical decisions for the multi-stage train classification problem. The main optimization issue refers to the allocation of tracks for performing multi-stage train classification minimizing annual operating costs. In order to validate the mathematical formulation and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, we conduct computational tests and case study experimentations based on infrastructural and operational conditions applied in Belgrade marshalling yard in Serbia.</p>",

Especially in technically advanced railway networks, the usage of computer based systems for dispatching and controlling traffic started quite early, e.g. large innovation programs in the 90s like Bahn2000 in Switzerland or BZ2000 in Germany and more. One component of these systems is a database component managing infrastructure data and topology information.\nInfrastructure databases usually are dedicated to regions of responsibilities, e.g. \u201cNiederlassung\u201d or \u201cRegionalbereich\u201d, managing infrastructure data for the corresponding region and bordering areas, e.g. lines and tracks from the region leading to surrounding regions. In this way, several, similar databases exists with partially overlapping data. With new IT systems, larger systems covering more regions are possible. Following an evolving (instead of an revolution) approach processes to merge and consolidate existing data and systems are required.\nThis talk presents an approach for migrating legacy databases and data structures from different, overlapping regions and for performing consistency checks with respect to topology, connectivity and infrastructure content and semantical matching of regional data.\nThe talk will present algorithms, heuristics and processes to merge and analyse consistency of consolidated infrastructure databases as developed and evaluated within real-world projects.</p>",

Under moving blocks, trains can operate at short headways based on individual train braking characteristics and track occupancy. Therefore, railway traffic flow, traditionally governed by fixed block signals, may begin to resemble highway traffic flow consisting of a continuous stream of vehicles interacting directly with each other. This research investigates if operations of freight trains around capacity bottlenecks caused by vertical grades or speed restrictions and controlled by moving blocks or fixed block wayside signal systems create shockwaves similar to those found in highway traffic streams. A macroscopic model is developed to produce density-flow curves describing operations of saturated, unidirectional, homogenous rail traffic around various combinations of grades and track speeds. Industry-standard railway traffic simulation software is used to validate the methodology. Model inputs and simulation headways are based on braking distances calculated for a typical North American bulk unit freight train. Results indicate that shockwave theory can predict the behaviour of rail traffic under fixed block and moving block control systems around stationary capacity bottlenecks caused by geography or civil speed restrictions. This knowledge can inform railway practitioner decisions on investment in advanced CBTC with moving blocks, future railway capital plans, and operating plans for new and existing lines with stationary bottlenecks.</p>",

Complexity of rescheduled timetable for a large-scale train service disruption changes significantly depending on rescheduling policy like turn around operation because it requires additional train arrangements. Then, dispatchers should decide rescheduling policy first of all to make their timetable rescheduling plan. These dicision making are quite important and rescheduling operations depends on dispatcher\u2019s individual skills currently. One of the most important issues is rescheduling techniques are not inherited among dispatchers effectively. Therefore we propose a new data-driven approach to support dispatcher\u2019s dicision based on historical train timetable data. We analyzed the past timetable data of railway service line in the Tokyo Metropolitan area and automatically extracted primary rescheduling components such as train cancellation. We have verified accuracy of our method regarding turn around operation by comparing with dispatcher\u2019s manual report. The result indicates estimation accuracy was more than 90%. In addition, we have developed the prototype system which suggests rescheduling policy to dispatchers.</p>",

In that simulator, train delay is predicted by estimating train operation curves of each train between stations. However, train operation curves could be calculated under fixed block signalling systems only. So, we cannot estimate effects of new train control systems, like moving block or prediction control.\nIn this research, we devised the fast estimation method for train operation curves under moving block. By that method, train operation curves can be calculated almost the same calculation time as that under fixed block. We also devised train control algorithm based on prediction control theory under moving block to minimize headway between successive trains.\nWe then implemented those methods to the simulator, and evaluated effects of installing moving block signalling system and prediction control in an actual commuter line in Japan.</p>",

There is long-lasting series of research and only some exemplary publication can be listed. Some microscopic simulation tools provide an explicit conflict detection and solution a synchronous and/or asynchronous manner. Recently optimisation components are applied within conflict solution, too. While either the simulation algorithm or the simulation evaluation is addressed within a variety of publications, the execution of studies relies on an important interim step: aggregation, validation and interpretation of simulation (raw) data. Barely no literature can be found. This fundamental task is subject of this paper. A -- mostly -- standardised principle how to eliminate modelling errors and ensure comparability of results is introduced. The principle is based on experience gathered in various consultancy activities.</p>",

Based on the monitoring data of meteorological indicators along the railway, a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering is first applied in order to figure out the fuzzy distribution of sample data and to fit the corresponding membership function of every indicator. According to the clustering results, every original sample is transformed into its cluster level as string data for the subsequent application of rough sets theory. Then a series of effective rough rules between conditional indicators and the decision indicator is extracted after attribute reduction by the Rosetta toolkit, where the decision indicator is represented by the train deceleration rate. Since the value of an indicator may correspond to several fuzzy levels, the multiple combinations of different conditional indicators will activate multiple rough rules. In order to forecast a clear value of the decision indicator, a centroid-based Max-Min compound arithmetic is applied to clarify relevant rules and determine the warning level. Using the designed algorithm, a case analysis of an HSR line section is conducted to verify the feasibility of the combined method, all meteorological data and operation records are provided by the Shanghai Railway Bureau in China. The results prove that the hybrid algorithm can be applied in the real-time forewarning of HSR train operation, with a global accuracy over 86%.</p>",

When the disruption occurs, dispatchers need to reassign trains to the conflict-free platform and route, even reschedule the arrival and departure times. To this end, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming formulation that determines platforming and routing decision simultaneously, while allowing trains to be rescheduled when the initial schedule imposes irreconcilable conflicts. The objective of our model is to minimize the overall deviation from the planned schedule and the original platforming plans. To improve the solving efficiency, an iterative algorithm is proposed to compute near-optimal solutions in a short computation time, which is based on the decomposition of the overall problem into two sub-problems: (i) platform and route assignment with fixed arrival and departure times, (ii) partial conflict trains rescheduling. The connecting information between two sub-problems concerns the index of conflict trains and the new train timetable. To solve sub-problem (i) efficiently, we develop a branch and bound algorithm which includes implicational rules enabling to speed up the computation and still can acquire optimal solutions. Since the model of sub-problem (ii) is the same as the model of original problem but has a relative small scale, it can be efficiently solved by CPLEX solver. A real-world instance with operation data of Zhengzhou East high-speed railway station, is implemented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>",

The aim of this keynote is therefore to illustrate how concepts and methods from transport economics can be useful for railway operations analysis, in particular analyses of capacity and regulations. I argue that the two fields have much to gain from a closer integration. I will do this by discussing three issues: a) timetable assumptions in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of increased capacity, b) crowding costs in public transport CBA, and c) slot trading between operators in open-access railway markets. </span></span></p>",

By means of a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication architecture trains can move in a virtually coupled platoon which can be treated as a single convoy at junctions, to improve capacity. This concept however introduces the need for additional safety constraints, especially at diverging junctions, which could make actual capacity improvements insufficient to justify investments. Hence, there is a need to understand capacity performances of Virtual Coupling and potential gains over state-of-practice signalling systems. This paper addresses this need by developing an innovative train-following model that captures operational states and corresponding transitions of trains running under Virtual Coupling. A comparative capacity analysis has been conducted for a portion of the South West Main Line in the UK. Promising results have been obtained, showing that the biggest capacity gains returned by Virtual Coupling relate to operational scenarios normally found in practice with trains having service stops and using different routes.</p>",

We do so by conducting a survey in which we ask both, railway practitioners who served as ordering party, and optimization experts who served as R&D solution provider.\nBy summarizing the most frequent replies to our question about the key factors why in the past mathematical optimization methods did not enter the practice of railways, we offer this knowledge base to future project managers. Acting accordingly with respect to definition of project goals, project design, and project management, hopefully lets them come up with even more true success stories of operations research methods in the practice of railways</p>",

However, in real-time, unexpected events such as overcrowded platforms or small mechanical defects can cause conflicts, i.e., two trains requiring the same part of the infrastructure at the same time. Currently, such conflicts are typically resolved by experienced dispatchers. However, it is impossible for them to fully anticipate the impact of their actions on the entire network. Conflict detection and prevention tools embedded in a Traffic Management System can help them in making informed decisions. Though some advanced train movement prediction and conflict detection has been developed in the last years, there still exists a need for conflict prevention strategies capable of delivering conflict resolutions on large and complex networks based on retiming, reordering and rerouting some of the trains in real-time.\nOur previous work introduced such a conflict prevention strategy that, based on offline calculations, determined which part of the network should be regarded when deciding on a conflict resolution. This work is significantly extended here by considering several new parameters for the Dynamic Impact Zone heuristic. This paper compares results on different sizes of networks, and tackles the challenges for applying the strategy on even larger networks.</p>",

On the other hand, once a train exceeds a dwell time due to sudden events such as passengers rushing onto a train, passengers agglomerating in specific cars and doors, objects getting caught in doors etc., delays propagate to subsequent trains quickly. To evaluate daily train transport stability and countermeasures against train delays, a train travel time simulation model is needed. However, it has been difficult so far to replicate the occurrence of sudden events and the fluctuations in passenger demand. In this paper, we use detailed data based on dwell time structure and on-site inspections to construct a train travel time simulator. In addition, we evaluate several case-studies of timetable adjustments and passenger demand variations.</p>",

The aim of this keynote is therefore to illustrate how concepts and methods from transport economics can be useful for railway operations analysis, in particular analyses of capacity and regulations. I argue that the two fields have much to gain from a closer integration. I will do this by discussing three issues: a) timetable assumptions in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of increased capacity, b) crowding costs in public transport CBA, and c) slot trading between operators in open-access railway markets.</span></span></p>",

Traditional surveys on passenger\u2019s travel patterns from door to door \u2013 e.g. postcard analysis, stop interviews and other types of interview surveys \u2013 have been very expensive. Knowledge on passenger flows, route choices and preferences have therefore limited to some extent.</p>\n<p>The lecture gives an overview of recent research in large-scale data sources, including smart card data, smartphone-based surveys, internet-based surveys, automatic counting systems and GPS-based tracing of vehicles and travelers, and how they can be merged and combined to obtain a better knowledge on passengers choices and preferences. Different applications of this is presented related to automatic OD-estimation, estimation of route choice models and analyses of arrival time distributions to stations. At the end of the lecture, examples are presented on how this knowledge can be used for a passenger oriented planning and optimization of public transport time-tables.</p>",

The technologies of the most serious vacuum tube transport projects, Hyperloop by E. Musk (SpaceX) and Swissmetro by M. Jufer et al. (EPF Lausanne), are assessed with regard to their principal aims, system approaches and technical feasibility. The vehicle design, propulsion, levitation and practical capacity of the two (near) vacuum tube transport projects are compared with existing railway and Maglev trains. The potential high-speed long-distance travel demand is assessed for \u201cSwissmetro\u201d corridors in Europe and the proposed Hyperloop link Los Angeles- San Francisco in California, respectively. Major technical and environmental alignment and construction constraints for the design of the tubes, guideway and stations are identified. The consistency and safety of possible operating programs for the investigated corridors of Swissmetro and Hyperloop, are evaluated respectively. Finally,  the main barriers and needs for further research and development are identified.</p>",

On the other hand, the integrated train control system consists of horizontal layers such as function layer, network layer, and terminal layer.

We use a two stage approach for the cost estimation of the required rolling stock. In the first stage, we determine a weekly rotation plan.

For metro lines with already high-frequency services, it is the train dwell time that determines the number of trains per hour in peak times. Passenger distribution on the platform affects the train dwell time, thereby the metro network capacity. This study has developed a model of passenger distribution on the metro platform. Not only are the layouts and congestion on the platform at the stations where passengers board the trains considered in the model, but also the passengers\u2019 origin-destination pairs, the waiting time and the platform layouts at the stations where passengers alight. Loadweigh data (the weight of passengers in each train car), which is an economical alternative to the traditional manual counting, has been used to calibrate the model. The model is validated by the Chi-Square goodness of fit test and performs well to reflect the causes of passenger distribution on the platform. A case study of 8 stations on Hammersmith&City line of London Underground shows that there were on average 16% of passengers in the morning peak chose boarding cars on the platforms based on the locations of the platform exits or interchange passageways at the stations where they would alight. The results would be useful for the metro operation planners and station staff to take measures to manage passenger distribution on the platform.</p>",

The problem lies on determining the actual arrival and departure time as well as the platform track assignment of trains at stations after a complete segment blockage caused by disruptions, where reasonable trains satisfying strict rules could be coupled with others to avoid being cancelled. A novel mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the total deviation of trains' arrival and departure time to that in the planned timetable. In the model, both the acceleration and deceleration time of trains when departing from and arriving at stations are explicitly considered, while the platform track of trains at passed stations is jointly optimized. A rolling horizon algorithm is designed to effectively solve large-scale problem instances since the rescheduling of timetables is usually determined in stages in practice. Test instances constructed based on the Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway in China are utilized to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches. Computational results demonstrate that the train coupling strategy is likely to reduce the total deviation and to relief the propagation of delays. Meanwhile, the rolling horizon algorithm can provide practically acceptable rescheduled timetables quickly.

Usually, track occupancy or indicators as delays are used to estimate how the system performs. In this article, we analyse the interaction of commuter and express train services. With help of microscopic simulation with RailSys, characteristics as delays are estimated for the regarded timetable slots and converted into a performance index. Assuming that the number of travellers is known, these individual indices can be converted into an index for the timetable alternative. \nA case study is performed on the Swedish Western Main line. Simulation is procured for all services on the line. Based on the results, an index is calculated for the respective timetabling alternatives. In that way, the effect of in-/decreased primary delays and supplements as well as major disturbances is analysed.\nThe model is shown to be relevant for capacity allocation and can be helpful for the timetabling process when the passenger demand can be estimated. Estimated delays can have larger impact than differences in travel times. The analysis also showed that with the commonly used valuations, socio-economic effects on commuter trains are much lower than for long-distance trains. For further development of the model, an adjustment of these parameters should be considered.</p>",

An efficient train-set assignment plan, including the assignment of utilization paths and maintenance tasks, should be designed and implemented in accordance with demand (utilization schedule) and maintenance requirements. Previous studies have adopted the fixed periodic maintenance (PM) strategy for the train-set assignment problem. However, the difference in the reliability of train-set is not considered in this strategy. Maintenance planners have to manually adjust utilization and maintenance tasks on the basis of experience. This study proposes an optimization process for assigning train-set to utilization paths and maintenance tasks in accordance with the predictive maintenance strategy (PdM) with trainset-specific reliability models. Results of the empirical study demonstrate that the developed process with predictive maintenance can assign utilization paths and schedule maintenance tasks to each trainset efficiently and reduce the total cost by over 11% compared with the PM-only strategy. Adopting this process can help planners improve the efficiency and reliability of train-set utilization.</p>",

The paper uses unique passenger load data about regional trains in Sweden and combines this with Swedish delay statistics for the same train numbers and from the same time periods. Results show that trains with high passenger numbers are not delayed to a greater extent compared to trains with fewer passengers. Train punctuality is thus a good indicator of traveller punctuality in this case. These results also suggest that long boarding and alighting times due to high passenger numbers are not a main cause of delays, possible causes of delays are instead external factors such as track maintenance or dense train movements. Therefore, this result suggests that policy makers should look further into the latter causes. Furthermore, the paper also compares the share of travellers and trains that are more than half an hour late, i.e. that are significantly late. These differences are also small but larger than for the less delayed trains. For one of the railway lines, trains with high passenger loads are more than proportionally hit by long delays. Such cases suggest that train control priorities could be re-examined with more focus on improving the service for railway travellers.</p>",

Hence, basic timetables are fairly vulnerable to random operational disturbances. In consequence of this, the service level for passengers decreases through a combination of delay propagation and delay accumulation. To solve this problem, a possibility widely used in research is to add extensive recovery and buffer times. Nevertheless, the resulting robust basic timetables would lead to a deterioration of the operating capacity, especially in congested areas. Another approach to reduce the impact of operational disturbances on railway operation is to use conventional dispatching algorithms. Unfortunately, most of them ignore further potential disturbances during the dispatching process, which is why the generated dispatching solution might even worsen train\u2019s punctuality. \n</p>\n<p>In this context, at the Institute of Railway and Transportation Engineering (IEV) at the University of Stuttgart a proactive dispatching algorithm has been developed, that generates dispatching solutions under the consideration of random disturbances in dynamic circumstances. The algorithm is divided into two main processes. First, the block sections are classified depending on their operational risk index by simulating numerous timetables with random disturbances generated in a Monte Carlo scheme and the related negative impacts in the studied railway network are calculated. Second, near-optimal dispatching solutions are automatically generated based on Tabu Search algorithm. This is achieved within a rolling time horizon framework, taking risk-oriented random disturbances in each block section into account.</p>",

Different from traditional capacity evaluation, infrastructure capacity utilization description shows detailed information on infrastructure utilization hidden in timetabling data instead of sheer number of trains that can be operated, or capacity consumed. Using a function system defined upon necessary operational inputs for timetabling in blocking time theory, we can obtain the feasibility condition for operating consecutive trains. Thus, the method to identify critical block section can be deduced from the feasibility condition. Structural indication determines the capacity utilization of consecutive train paths, which can be further integrated into a bi-directional graph to model infrastructure capacity utilization description followed by infrastructure time allocation. Consumed capacity of railway infrastructure by operating train runs can be formulated. Besides, a general procedure is proposed to analyse the sensitivity of consumed capacity to operational inputs. An experimental case study is conducted to demonstrate the application of this method in analysing the impact of speed and recovery time.</p>",

However, even algorithms that try to adapt/add to an existing timetable rely on mixed integer programming, on graph theory etc., but do not use the geometric representation of the time table. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining residual train paths (e.g., for freight trains) in an existing time table close to operation. We aim to restrict possible disturbance on existing (passenger) traffic, and, hence, insert train paths of a specified minimum temporal distance to other trains.\nWe show how we can use algorithms for thick paths in polygonal domains to compute the maximum number of trains with a specified robustness to insert.</p>",

In a highly dynamic transportation market, train timetabling is an essential bridge connecting the service supplier with transportation demand. However, in present operations, train scheduling without considering passenger demand can reduce competitive advantages of railway in the multimodal transportation market and will further lead to passenger dissatisfaction. Therefore, it\u2019s important to schedule trains responding to passenger demand in the train planning process. In this paper, we focus on the problem of train timetabling with passenger demand, specifically deciding train stop plan based on different origin-destination passenger demand pairs. Taking the stop indicators as important decision variables, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to address this train timetabling and stopping plan integration issue, with minimizing total train travel time and maximizing the number of transported passengers. The weighted-sum method is used to find the Pareto optimal solutions for the proposed bi-objective mathematical model. A set of numerical tests is presented based on Beijing-Jinan high-speed railway line (part of Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line) by Cplex optimization solver to validate the model.</p>",

Many approaches are available to reschedule traffic in a network partition but very few works address the coordination of these partitions. In railway systems with very dense traffic, e.g. the Swiss one, it is not always possible to partition the network such that the rescheduling algorithms can work on completely independent regions. This paper proposes a coordination approach for adjacent local rescheduling algorithms. These algorithms are based on the Resource Conflict Graph model, which enables the representation of the interlocking system at a very fine granularity. Simulations on data from the Swiss Federal Railways show the validity of this approach in improving the consistency of decisions at the common boundaries of adjacent local rescheduling algorithms.</p>",

This means drivers of rapid trains have too much freedom in driving. Thus, if drivers of rapid trains do not run the train \u201cproperly,\u201d delays occur for the train or for the succeeding train. Hence, in order to realize high punctuality, rapid trains must run so that they do not stop nor do not give an influence to the succeeding train, which is almost impossible if no information is given. In this paper, we propose an idea to specify not only arrival and departure times but running speed of rapid trains at critical sections in a timetable to make the train operation more punctual. In order to realize this idea, we settled two issues. One is to establish a method to decide the location and the running speed there in the timetabling process. The other is to implement a system which shows the speed information to drivers in an economical way. We have applied this approach when we revised our timetable in March 2018 and from the analysis of the historical train traffic data for several months, we have confirmed that the delays were greatly reduced and our approach was very successful.</p>",

A reasonable train service scheme can provide satisfactory services for passengers and reduce the operational cost for operators. This paper focuses on the optimal train service design problem in an urban transit line, where both the short-turn services and the train size of each service are considered. A service network based on a given pool of candidate train services with provided turn-back stations is constructed. The optimal strategy is used to assign passenger flows on the service network so as to describe the transfer process of passengers between different train services. Considering many operational and capacity constraints, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model minimizing the sum of the operators\u2019 cost and passengers\u2019 waiting time cost is developed to identify train services from the service pool and determine the train size and frequency of each chosen service. The nonlinear model is transformed into a linear one, and two simplification methods named service network simplification and OD pair aggregation are proposed to improve further the computational efficiency of the model. Finally, realistic instances from Chongqing Rapid Rail Transit Line 26 in China are used to test the proposed approaches. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce the operators\u2019 cost and the passengers\u2019 waiting time cost compared with the empirical method frequently used in practice.</p>",

Varying train running and stopping times entail larger train separations and yield non-usable time slots in train timetables and operations. In the present paper we aim to assess the effects of variability on the capacity of railway corridors in long term planning of rail traffic. Our main focus are metro transit systems in urban areas, where the effects of fluctuations of running and stopping times are particularly pronounced due to dense operations. The investigation comprises uncertainty of train stopping and running times as well as of the traffic concept itself, such as variations of headways and line frequencies.</p>\n<p>On the system level, inhomogeneity tends to propagate in the network, yielding non-usable capacity, which is why we propose a stochastic modeling of rail corridors. Our model is motivated by finite capacity transfer lines, which have been studied in the context of manufacturing systems. The corridor is viewed as a sequence of heavily correlated service stations representing line segments and stations, for which effective throughput, distributions of train running times and service quality are calculated. The performance of the model is tested in a case study for the central link of the mass transit system in Cologne. In addition, an outlook on how the model can be extended to general heavy-rail corridors with different types of train services is provided.</p>",

In this paper travel time reliability is measured as the average delay, and a delay prediction model for MILP timetable optimization is presented. The average delay prediction model takes into consideration time supplements, buffer times and propagation of delays in the railway network and is not restricted to a fixed order of the trains. Validation of the average delay prediction model, and an evaluation of the approach with combined simulation-optimization for improving railway timetables, are conducted by a simulation study on a part of the Swedish Southern Main Line. Results from the simulation study show that the average delays are reduced by up to approximately 40% and that the punctuality is improved by up to approximately 8%.</p>",

The concept of base train equivalent (BTE) was proposed to standardize different train types into a universal unit, namely, base train unit (BTU). However, the previously developed delay-based model suffers from consistency issue, and its application is limited to only two train types. Thus, this study proposes a new concept of delay-based BTE computation and corresponding BTE models. The dynamic BTE model considers volume and heterogeneity and aims to reflect fully the actual capacity impact of non-base trains. The fixed BTE model identifies the most appropriate BTE value at a particular traffic heterogeneity. Results from the case studies demonstrate that the proposed method can address scenarios with all types of traffic mixes and multiple train types. The unit of delay-based rail capacity can be converted into a standard unit using the proposed models. The effect of an additional train can be easily assessed, and the capacity measurements from different lines or systems can be compared and evaluated.</p>",

To improve the network\u2019s performance, this paper proposes a profit-oriented line planning model for collaboratively optimizing the operational costs and passenger travel times. Due to the complexity of the problem, an iterative approach is designed to solve the problem efficiently. Two case studies are implemented to verify the performance of the approach. The results of the small example show that the best found line plan can save up to 6% of the travel time compared to the initial solution and improve the profit with 2%. The proposed iterative approach also performs well in searching for high-quality solutions on the large railway network.</p>",

The method takes into account the human operator needs of avoiding possible hazards and extra workloads. A novel Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is proposed for optimization the train trajectory in real-time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conduct a numerical simulation with real-life infrastructure, train and timetable data. We conduct deterministic optimization, which regards the system as having no uncertainty in its parameters, and then perform stochastic optimization (ADP), which takes the uncertainty into account in the optimization process, and compare the outcomes. The results successfully verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>",

The timetable compression method described in UIC Code 406 has become one of the standard tools in this area. Motivated by the Swedish Transportation Administration's timetable independent adaptation of the methodology and its need for extension we explore how the compression method can be applied to evaluate the capacity of the underlying infrastructure for strategic planning rather than the occupation ratio of a specific timetable. By performing ensemble averaging of scheduled train sequences we abstract from a single timetable concept and perform a distributional analysis of timetable utilization. The methodology is applied in capacity assessment of railway stations and line segments. To mitigate decomposition-induced underestimation of network effects the compression area is extended and approaches to include interdependencies between stations and lines are investigated. The methodology is tested in a case study based on data from the Swedish Southern Mainline rail corridor.</p>",

This paper studies the problem of re-optimization of train platforming, where the train station is modeled using discretization of the platform track time-space resources. To solve the re-optimization problem, we propose a binary integer programming model which minimizes the weighted sum of total train delays as well as platform track utilization costs, subject to constraints defined by operational requirements. Moreover, we design an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the model with a good precision. A real-world case is taken as an example to show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show that the model established in this paper can describe re-optimization of train platforming accurately and can be solved quickly by the proposed heuristic algorithm. In addition, the model and algorithm developed in this paper can provide an effective computer-aided decision-making tool for the train dispatchers in case of train delays.</p>",

Two decomposition methods are considered, namely a geography-based decomposition and a train-based decomposition. We propose an integer linear optimization approach to implement the geography-based decomposition of the integrated optimization problem. With the decomposition, a number of sub-problems (that correspond to partitions of a railway network or trains) with couplings are obtained. We further introduce three distributed optimization approaches to deal with the couplings among the sub-problems. Experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the three proposed distributed optimization approaches, in terms of feasibility, computational efficiency, solution quality, and (estimated) optimality.</p>",

Based on given infrastructures and train line plans, there are some timetabling strategies which affect the capacity utilization, e.g. changing train departure sequence at origin stations, overtakings between trains, and adding new train stop at stations. Nowadays, managers of high-speed railway in China are eager to find out that what kind of impact these strategies have on the capacity utilization. In this study, new variables of train stops and constraints of overtakings are proposed with an extended cyclic timetabling model based on the periodic event scheduling problem (PESP). Minimum cycle time, train travel time and the total number of train stops are calculated as objectives to measure the differences between the strategies. The effectiveness of the three timetabling strategies are compared and presented by a series of experiments based on one real-world rail line in China. According to our results, with flexible train departure sequence at the origin stations and train overtakings, the possibility of acquiring good capacity utilization can be higher, but too many overtakings will have negative effect on the quality of timetable. The effectiveness of adding new stops on the capacity utilization depends on the ways of adding stops, i.e. which train is allowed to be added new stops and which stations can be selected to stop at.</p>",

This paper extends the railway capacity estimation problem by considering the electrical multiple unit (EMU) circulation. A MIP model based on a hybrid time-space-state network is applied to optimize the capacity utilization with the objective function of maximizing the number of desired trains. To overcoming the computation difficulties on a very large scale problem, a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach is proposed. This decomposes the model into timetabling sub-problem and EMU circulation sub-problem by dualizing the consistency constraints. We use the data of Beijing to Tianjin intercity railway to show the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental result shows that the total throughput of the railway system depends on either the infrastructure capacity or the EMU circulation according to different fleet sizes. A multi-objective Pareto analysis is conducted for analyzing the trade-off between different type of trains. The benefit of the decomposition solution approach is displayed by the performance comparison with the centralized and sequential method.</p>",

Serving different kinds of passengers in emergency situation is a reflection of reliability of rail transportation. While unavoidable stochastic perturbations (e.g. bad weather) disrupt air transportation causing interruptions, rail rescheduling demand is produced deriving from the interruption of air transport, which defined as Unpredicted Large Passenger Flow (simply for ULPF) in this paper. The problem encountered by dispatchers is to reschedule trains to serve ULPF. We address the optimization problem of rescheduling trains to serve ULPF causing by interruptions of air transportation. In this paper, we focus on the rescheduling of High-speed Railway to evacuate ULPF, since the characteristic of air transport passengers, which are willing to pay high cost for short time, is different from other modes. Three dispatching strategies, which are organizing the seats remained, inserting new trains and the combination of the above two with transfer (e.g. passengers arrive at the destination through transfer between existing train and inserting new train), are used to reschedule ULPF in this paper. Moreover, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model is constructed for rescheduling trains to serve ULPF. The proposed model is solved by a standard ILP solver.</p>",

Many urban and national railway networks face increasing capacity saturation issues, while the transport demand keeps growing for both passengers and freight. Likewise, high-speed networks in Europe and China are expanding rapidly and attract more and more passengers as sustainable and fast alternative for flying. And similar to the demand for international freight train corridors that often share tracks with national passenger railway networks. To enable this growth the railways are in a transition to modern digital railway traffic systems with continuous wireless communication for efficient signalling and traffic management. The timetable becomes increasingly more accurate to allow optimized infrastructure occupation, while train operation is supported by driver advisory systems connected to intelligent traffic management systems. Automatic train operation is already the standard in modern metro systems and will also be applied to other railway systems to realize the highest capacity consumption. The transfer to this modern digital technology is a challenge to the railway sector and requires an innovative integrated approach with the aim to achieve a safe, efficient and reliable transport system. This presentation gives an overview of the challenges ahead and the role of railway operation research in these innovations.</p>",

It was not a classic metro train but a 30,000+ tonnes bulk iron ore train, comprising 220-240 wagons, each weighing 130-160 tonnes when laden, and hauled by 2x3280 kW diesel locomotives.  This paper discusses the usual rationales for developing autonomous trains and then tests them against the realities of running heavy haul freight trains in remote areas.  Any apparent lack of line capacity is less important than the need for reliable mine-to-port supply chains.  Furthermore, mining in remote areas is expensive and increasingly difficult to resource so automation of processes is increasingly attractive to mining companies.  The automation of iron ore railway operations beckoned if mining companies could assemble, test and have accepted the various technical building blocks.  Pilbara Iron has now completed these steps.</p>",

Such operations require parking train units on shunting yards located close to platforms. Therefore trains have to be moved between platform and shunting tracks. Taking over train units between their arrival and their departure in a station constitutes shunting. The Generalized Train Unit Shunting problem (G-TUSP) is the problem of shunting operations planning. The problem is to assign arriving train units to departing train units, shunting tracks and paths, to schedule shunting movements and to assign crews to maintenance operations. The aim of the paper is to provide an algorithmic approach for the G-TUSP. The contribution presents an integrated problem with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The formulation is based on a microscopic model of the infrastructure and formal train units in order to consider coupling and uncoupling. The model is solved exactly using the commercial solver CPLEX. It is tested on instances based on Metz-Ville station in France. The results are promising and show the suitability of the model.</p>",

Hence, accurate predictions of the number of affected trains (NATs) and the total time of affected trains (TTATs) due to PDs can provide a theoretical background for the dispatch of trains in real time. Train operation data were obtained from Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway (HSR) station from 2015 to 2016, and the NAT and TTAT influence factors were determined after analyzing the PD propagation mechanism. The NAT predictive model was established using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) algorithm which was more efficient than other machine learning methods after comparison. Furthermore, the TTAT predictive model was established based on the NAT model using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. The results indicate that the XGBOOST algorithm has good performance on the NAT predictive model, whereas SVR is the best method for the TTAT model using Lessthan5 variable, which is the ratio of the difference between the sample size of actual and the predicted values in less than 5 min and the total sample size. In addition, 2018 data were used to evaluate the application of NAT and TTAT models over time. The results indicate that NAT and TTAT models have a good application over time.</p>",

To further efficiently improve the conditions, this paper proposes an effective collaborative optimization method for the accurate passenger flow control strategies on an oversaturated urban rail transit line by simultaneously adjusting the number of inbound passengers entering multiple stations on the line. Through considering the space-time dynamic characteristics of passenger flow, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to firstly minimize the number of passengers who are limited to enter stations, secondly minimize the total passenger waiting time on platforms at all of involved stations where the optimal passenger flow control is imposed to avoid congestion on platforms within the transportation capacities, and thirdly maximize the passenger person-kilometres. Due to a small scale of the model, it can be solved by CPLEX solver efficiently. Moreover, because the passenger flow demand is time-variant, it\u2019s very necessary for an accurate and easy-to-implement passenger flow control strategy to determinate the control time intervals. Hence, in order to get an optimal determination of the control time intervals, Fisher optimal division method is firstly applied to after modelling. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments, including a small-scale case and a real-world instance with operation data of Chengdu metro system, are implemented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>",

Compared with weekdays, the number of high-speed railway passengers increases sharply during holidays and the spatial distribution of the passenger trips is diverse in different days. Thus, how to optimize holiday train line plan (HTLP) for high-speed railway to meet the fluctuation of passenger demand is becoming more and more important. Meanwhile, the objectives of reducing the railway operation cost and ensuring the similarity between the holiday and the weekday line plan should be considered. Nowadays, HTLP is usually made by manually adjusting train formation and adding extra trains based on weekday line plans, which have low flexibility and adaptability to satisfy holiday\u2019s passenger demand. This study mainly focuses on the optimization of HTLP based on weekday line plans using a theoretical method to improve the adaptability and benefit of line plans. Compared with the holiday line plans in real-world, our experimental results show that our optimized HTLP has less train operation cost and more similarity with the weekday line plans. And the service level of high-speed railway is also improved. Based on the experimental results, the effectiveness of our proposed model and solution method has been proved. The proposed mathematical optimization model and method can be used to improve the holiday line plan of high-speed railway.</p>",

Using train for freight transportation can help to tackle both problems: because of its high loading capacity and because in Europe, railway networks are mainly electrified. However, freight transportation by rail in Europe is much reduced when compared to road transportation. As a consequence, the European authorities try to improve rail infrastructures and connectivity, to increase the efficiency of rail transport and also to increase its share in the European transport market to decongest roads and to reduce pollutant emissions.\nIn this paper, a mathematical programming-based model is presented for assessing a capacity expansion problem on a railway network. In this model, the authors have considered extensions of elements of an existent freight railway network, jointly with actions on the network with relative smaller cost, such as the inclusion of new sidings or new gauges in several rail segments, expansion of classification terminals or stations, and also capacity enhancements by new blocking/control systems. These aspects are usually not taken into account in models for regional planning.  Our approach, rather than a model of railway capacity expansion can be considered a mixture of capacity-expansion with network design. The model is tested on a small regional network of the Mediterranean Corridor, and the computational results show its applicability to larger networks.</p>",

This paper considers scheduling of rolling stock, which is usually done by creating a roster. A roster is a series of trains to be performed by the particular rolling stock. The number of train-sets required to operate a given group of trains is essentially determined by the roster and generation of an efficient roster is essential. Important considerations of the roster generation include maintenance such as pre-departure inspection. On some lines in Japan, splitting and combining are often used to adjust transportation capacity flexibly. Under this type of operation, splitting and combining become necessary. These shunting operations require time and manpower, so it is necessary to reduce the amount of splitting and combining. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model so that the amount of splitting and combining is reduced together with the roster length and the distance of empty runs. Results of computational studies will be presented based on real instances of several lines in Japan, indicating the computational effectiveness of the methodology and with respect to the reasonableness of the resultant rosters.</p>",

The model proposed a method for developing the stochastic one-step transition matrices for the running time delays (for recovery) and the conflict resolution delays (for deterioration) using the real-life train operation data. It is possible to estimate the delay distributions at stations under the effects of running time supplements and buffer times. Hence, the model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the time supplements embedded into the train schedules, in addition to some other performance measures. In this current investigation, the use of the stochastic matrices is expanded to predict train delay states at the stations ahead along the train path. We investigate the effects of the recovery and deterioration transition matrices developed in combination with the current delay state of a particular train in order to predict its expected time of arrival at subsequent stations. The recovery and deterioration matrices are used in the prediction repeatedly (as many times as needed) whenever a new prediction is made. The former matrix is considered in the prediction when a train run occurs and the latter one is considered when a train is expected to interfere with another train. In addition to the delay and trajectory prediction, the model can also be used to trace delay propagation and to measure schedule robustness. The goodness of the model predictions is assessed against the real-life data for train movements.</p>",

In the practice, the operation of pedestrian facilities plan is always associated with the staff assignment. Hence, we develop a machine learning based integrated pedestrian facilities planning and staff assignment optimization model in transfer stations to schedule the pedestrian facilities plan and the staff assignment together. It aims to minimize the staff assignment cost and the deviation of working time of each employee of the station. The minimizing of the deviation gains the fairness of the assignment plan. The facilities plan is enforced by the level-of-services requirement in three performance indicators including transfer capacity, transfer average time and level-of-service. The performance indicators of facilities plans are evaluated by a simulation-based machine learning method. Based on simulation results, the random forest method fits a quantitative relationship among performance indicators of the facilities plans with operation scenario attributes and facilities plan attributes. The experiments on the case study of Xipu station show the integrated model can return pedestrian facilities plans which meet the level of service requirements and assign employees fairly of each period in a day and minimize the labor cost. The solutions of pedestrian facilities plan and staff assignment plan for possible operation scenarios in future are also suggested to station manager by our integrated method.</p>",

For these timetables and rotation plans, i.e., plans of railway vehicle movements are constructed as templates for these periods. During operation the rotation plans are affected by all kinds of unplanned events. An unusal example for that is the collapse of a tunnel ceiling near Rastatt in southern Germany due to construction works related to the renewal of the central station in Stuttgart. As a result the main railway connection between Stuttgart and Frankfurt am Main, located on top of the tunnel, had to be closed from August 12th to October 2nd 2017. This had a major impact on the railway network in southern Germany. Hence, all rotation plans and train schedules for both passenger and cargo traffic had to be revised. In this paper we focus on a case study for this situation and compute new rotation plans via mixed integer programming for the ICE high speed fleet of DB Fernverkehr AG one of the largest passenger railway companies in Europe. In our approach we take care of some side constraints to ensure a smooth continuation of the rotation plans after the disruption has ended.</p>",

Now, temperatures are approaching a higher stage of +1.5\u00b0C and the attention is on both CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Transportation is a major component of the environmental impact, accounting for approximately 30% of air pollution and energy consumption. Due to the rapid urbanization in the EU, with an estimated 74.3% of the population living in cities, forecasted to rise to 80% by 2050, urban mobility is dramatically increasing its relevance. Therefore, a reduction in energy consumption and pollutant emissions is a crucial factor to consider in developing urban transportation and particularly rail-based systems, able to provide energy saving transport services by improving urban environment. Several methods and techniques are under development to improve the energy performance of Light Rail Transport (LRT), which spread from different typologies of power supply to improving energy efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to start from the last developments and innovative energy sources for LRT systems. The focus is on two parts: a) trams running on Hydrogen in parallel with on board batteries with energy saving control techniques, b) potential renewable energy sources to meet power demand. The comparison is with traditional power sources and equipment (e.g. Catenary-based). The methods, based on selected indicators, are under development and test by calculations and simulations with reference to the case study of the new tramlines in the city of Brescia (Italy).</p>",

One of the effective ways to reduce the energy consumption is to collaboratively optimize the driving strategy and train timetable by considering the regenerative energy (RE). However, the dimensionality and computational time will increase accordingly in optimization as the number of operating trains rises. With the intention of tackling this problem by efficiently reducing dimensionality, the energy-efficient metro train operation problem is optimized in this paper by applying the discrete differential dynamic programming (DDDP) approach. Firstly, the model calculating the net energy consumption that takes into account the RE is formulated. Then, the optimization model will be transformed to a discrete decision problem by using Space-Time-Speed (STS) network methodology, and the corresponding solution will be obtained through the DDDP based algorithm. Finally, two case studies will be conducted in a metro network to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>",

However, it has to be adapted each time a change in the input data occurs. In this paper, we focus on the costs in the adaptation phase. We introduce the concept of adaptive nominal solution which minimizes adaptation costs with respect to a given set of potential changes. We illustrate this framework with the rolling stock scheduling problem with scenarios corresponding to increasing demand in terms of rolling stock units. We define adaptation costs for a rolling stock schedule and propose two MILPs. The first one adapts, at minimal cost, an existing rolling stock schedule with respect to a given scenario. The second MILP considers a set of given scenarios and computes an adaptive nominal rolling stock schedule together with an adapted solution to each scenario, again while minimizing adaptation costs. We illustrate our models with computational experiments on realistic SNCF instances.</p>",

The traffic then run with single track operation which heavily affects the capacity and need to be planned in an early stage, before the yearly timetable is finalized. Today, in Sweden, there are some difficulties when planning for maintenance works and how to adapt the reduced capacity in the timetable. Due to an increased demand for capacity and for better punctuality from train operators, there is a need for more well thought-out strategies for how to handle the capacity restriction and for how much robustness is needed in the timetable to preserve a certain quality. \nIn this paper, we present a study which assess strategies for double track maintenance work leading to single track operations. A simulation study is performed in which three different timetable strategies are tested and evaluated. The aim is to find strategies and timetable rules to better handle capacity reductions at double track lines so that trains can run with high quality even though there are maintenance works at the same time.\nIn the paper we discuss the advantages and disadvantages with the three strategies and how they affect train slots, runtimes and punctuality. We propose a strategy for how to best consider single track operations, depending on the length of the single track section, speed restriction and traffic pattern, including hands-on timetable rules.</p>",

In order to proactively improve the service quality and efficiency of the railway system, the short-term passenger flow prediction technique is vital in the field of operation and management system. Utilizing the deep learning library-keras, the study develops a Long short-term memory neural network (LSTM NN) to predict the short-term high-speed rail (HSR) passenger flow. Processing the raw data, we first construct the passenger flow sequences as the input (output) variables. Then the gird search and cross validation techniques are applied to optimize the LSTM NN parameters. At last we utilize the data provided by Shanghai railway administration of China as the case study. Through a comparison with other representative methods, including Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), results suggest that the proposed LSTM NN can generate great potentials for accurate passenger flow predictions.</p>",

Limiting the number of train stops to reduce travel time conflicts with the goal of increasing passengers\u2019 opportunity to gain direct connections. In addition, long trains with frequent stops occupy too much route capacity, while disconnected short trains make passengers to transfer. To handle the trade-offs, this paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model that determines optimal combinations of train stopping patterns, and we particularly consider the practice that many long trains use skip-stopping strategy. The objective of the model minimizes time loss and transfer time of passengers. Specifically, we intend to run fast trains between major stations, such that travel time of many passengers with long distance trips can be shortened; meanwhile, to operate a certain number of short trains with dense-stopping or all-stopping patterns so as to ensure connectivity level between non-major stations and passengers can have frequent direct or transfer train options. We design a genetic algorithm procedure to manage real-size instances. We have tested our model and algorithm for the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed rail line in China, which is a 2,298 km line with 36 stations. Numerical results indicate that our approach improves the travel efficiency of passengers compared with an existing train stopping schedule. We also explore the trade-offs among different train stopping strategies and their impact on travel efficiency of passengers.</p>",

IT systems can contribute to determine the actual boundaries of the use of available production resources and operate optimally close to these bounds. \nMathematical optimization and automation are key factors to realize this, e.g. in the field of Locomotive rotation planning.\nThis contribution describes different approaches that have been implemented in the Locomotive Optimization System LOOP which has been developed by DXC Technology in close cooperation with Green Cargo \u2013 the largest rail cargo operator in Sweden.\nThe main purpose of the system is to create plans for template weeks of cyclic planning (e.g. for simulation studies on the procurement of locomotives of different type) and dated monthly plans for short term planning. Different mathematical models are used to consider the various aspects of the objective function, e.g. number of locomotives used, operational efficiency and penalisation of loco changes in multiple traction. The consideration of conditions imposed by surrounding planning problems (e.g. crew, wagon transport) has been one of the biggest challenges in the project. The resulting mixed integer linear programming models are solved by commercial solver (CPLEX). The planners work in a web-based user interface, which is based on DXCs Rail Cargo Management Solution used by more than 20 customers throughout Europe.\nThe close cooperation between the railway operator and the IT solution provider resulted in a solution which allows building plans in shorter time than previously and saving locomotives.</p>",

In some countries, dispatchers have predefined emergency plans at hand. These plans' flexibility and applicability are questionable as disruptions may be unique in timing, occurrence, or traffic state.  In this paper, we present a novel approach for timetable rescheduling by introducing the concept of \\textit{archetypical infrastructure pieces} (AIPs): frequently occurring parts of the infrastructure. We consider three AIPs outside station areas, ranging from (i) double-track corridors between two double switches without, and (ii) including stops, to (iii) multi-track corridors with stops. For each AIP, a machine-scheduling based mathematical model is presented. Additional service constraints can be included to retrieve more practicable results, or to improve passenger experience. Extensive experiments show that the models outperform heuristics representative for dispatchers' decision-making by effectively balancing between re-timing, re-ordering, stop-skipping, and cancelling trains. We estimate that disruptions on about 50\\% of the Belgian railway network outside of station areas, can be considered using our three AIP models. Dispatchers could employ the models by characterizing the disruption and the infrastructure around it with a limited set of parameters. This approach allows to combine the models\u2019 merit of efficiently balancing between measures, with the dispatcher\u2019s knowledge on the surroundings of the corridor, and passenger expectations.</p>",

However, this vertical separation has proved problematic, not least in terms of assessing the trade-offs between capacity utilisation and performance in terms of reliability and punctuality. A possible solution is virtual integration where an alliance is formed between the infrastructure manager and the dominant railway undertaking.  The first such alliance in Great Britain was between Network Rail and South West Trains (SWT) and ran from 2012 to 2015.  This paper undertakes a statistical analysis of public performance measures and cancelled and significantly late services for SWT and two comparator railway undertakings, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Southeastern. There are no indications that virtual integration led to an improvement in the performance of SWT services but some indication that deteriorations were less than those for GTR, but this could be explained by other external factors.  Overall, there is no clear indications that there were changes in punctuality and reliability trends for SWT as a result of virtual integration. Thus performance did not present a reason to end the virtual alliance between NR and SWT but nor did it provide reasons for continuing.</p>",

A well-designed feeder train timetable with good transfer quality in the AH integration service is of great significance, especially when train frequencies are low in a transfer node. To assess the transfer quality, we classify the transfers based on the transfer time. In this study, a bi-objective train timetabling model is proposed to maximize the quality of transfers from trains to flights and minimize the deviation from the original official timetable in the AH integration service. By optimizing the two objectives independently in two stages, a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. In the first stage, the first objective is optimized; in the second stage, the timetable shift is minimized by the rolling horizon approach with the transfer quality fixed. The method is applied to Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport, China. The result indicates that the proposed model is effective in improving the transfer quality and decreasing the timetable shift, and some analysis of solution are presented to verify the efficiency of the suggested model.</p>",

This paper presents a professional research conducted for the Finnish Transport Agency aimed at the development of methods to evaluate such impacts. Two methods are proposed. The first is aimed at capacity estimation, and is an adaptation of the UIC 406 method to the characteristics of the Finnish rail network. The second is a method based on mathematical regression that allows estimating delays on lines given a set of parameters describing their characteristics. The delay estimation method proposes two distinct formulas for single- and double-track lines. The proposed methods were studied both on Finnish actual data and on a UK scenario. The use of these methods enables network managers to evaluate both network saturation and the effect of investments on delays in a simple way. This study has been approved and adopted by the Finnish Transport Agency.</p>",

Consequently, there is a significant potential to achieve energy savings with improved driving strategy, which can be influenced by providing useful information to the train driver. As part of the smartrail programme operated by the Swiss railway industry, several energy savings measures are due to be implemented. As a first step in the smartrail energy measures, SBB conducted a pilot test in summer 2018. This pilot involved 473 test runs on two important passenger trains in Switzerland: the long-distance train IC5 and the local train S12 from Zurich. For each train run, based on effective routing, train composition, speed restrictions and timetable fixed points, a speed profile and new service times for each station were calculated early each morning for all the train runs of the day. \nMore than 80% of the regular train drivers would welcome the rollout of the new timetable information soon. A comparison of the accompanied journeys against the \u2018baseline\u2019 (same trains in the same period) shows a significant reduction in energy consumption without affecting punctuality: depending on the train journey, the accompanied runs consumed between 1.4% and 13.3% less energy per gross tonne-kilometre. \nThe high levels of acceptance by the train drivers combined with the significant energy savings achieved without affecting punctuality is very promising. For this reason, a system-wide rollout is currently being investigated and could be started by late 2019.</p>",

Railway operations generate a lot of data that can be used for understanding complex phenomena and improving the current processes by means of ML. This lecture has the purpose to introduce and enable academics and professionals to be able to effectively use ML in their work. In the first part we will introduce the main theoretical concepts and decompose a typical machine learning project into a sequence of steps and procedures from problem understanding to model deployment. A life cycle of an ML project will then be demonstrated on an example from railway operations.

The passenger dataset is framed for the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, considering the expectation input format of LSTM layers and the characteristics of the data. The Keras model in Python is used to fit LSTM model with tuning and regulating all the parameters necessary in the model. Then the fitted LSTM model is applied to forecast the short-term departing passenger flow of Beijing-Guangzhou high speed railway. The influence of important parameters in the LSTM model on the prediction accuracy is analyzed, and the comparison with other representative passenger flow forecast models is conducted. The results show that the LSTM model can get the valid information in a long passenger flow time series and achieve a better performance than other models. The passenger flow prediction errors valued by MAPE are 7.36%, 7.33%, 8.03%, respectively for Chenzhou station, Hengyang station and Shaoguan station. The parameters in the LSTM model such as the number of neurons, the input historical data length and the size of output layer have a great influence on the prediction accuracy.</p>",

This paper first illustrates the necessity of assessing the corridor\u2019s capacity as a whole without decomposition. Based on the concept of base train equivalent (BTE), two methods named \u201ccapacity occupancy equivalent (COE)\u201d method and \u201cdemand adaptation equivalent (DAE)\u201d method are developed to standardize different types of trains into an equivalent unit. The case study of Jing-Hu high-speed railway corridor demonstrates that the methodology is concise in capacity assessment, and the impact of the long-distance direct service on corridor capacity utilization is also calculated.</p>",

Battery train is used as the train which can travel in catenary-free section using power supplied from an onboard storage system such as lithium-ion battery. However, as characteristics of this type of train, an energy consumption of battery train depends on the state of energy of the storage system. Furthermore, battery train needs rapid charging when running the long distance. Hence, energy efficient design of catenary-free transportation system is important. In consideration of these characteristics, in this research, we propose a generation method of the timetable including running time, dwell time and location of charging infrastructure which is the most energy-saving for catenary-free transportation system with battery trains. Firstly, we conduct a running simulation and reveal the relationship among running time, state of charge of the battery and energy consumption. The characteristic is derived as a two-variable function and nonlinear for each variable. Although this optimization problem can be defined as a nonlinear programming problem, we ease to solve this problem using linear approximation to the energy consumption characteristic. Specifically, we use a method of dividing  the characteristic defined on the space as curved surfaces into fine lattice shapes and approximating it as a polyhedron composed of minute triangles. In the end, we carried out a simulation in a simple case so that we can show the effect of the proposed method.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Railway operations in dense traffic areas are very sensitive even to small disturbances, and thus require careful planning and real-time management. Dwell times in stations are in particular subject to a high variability and are hard to predict; this is mostly due to the interactions between passengers and the system during the dwelling process. This paper proposes an approach for estimating the minimum dwell time knowing the numbers of alighting, boarding and on board passengers, using Automatic Vehicle Location and Automatic Passenger Counting data. Based on the knowledge of this value, a method for estimating the conditional distribution of dwell time given passenger flows is presented. Numerical experiments are carried out on two stations located inside the dense traffic area of Paris suburban network. The obtained results show a broad applicability of these methods, that hence seem very promising.</p>",

One of the research areas to improve the energy efficiency of railways is energy-efficient train control (EETC). EETC is an optimal control problem with the aim of finding the driving strategy or trajectory that meets the timetable with the least amount of energy consumption. The potential for EETC is determined by the timetable, because the running time supplements determine how much energy can be saved by energy-efficient driving.  Therefore, in this paper we focus on the optimal distribution of running time supplements for the energy-efficient driving of a single train over multiple stops. Furthermore, we compare an indirect solution method to a direct solution method to solve the EETC problem, and apply the two methods to different case studies to find the optimal distribution of running time supplements to achieve the most energy-efficient driving. The indirect method is used by the Energymiser Driver Advice Systems. Direct solutions are found using the Radau Pseudospectral Method. The results of the direct solution method confirm the optimality conditions used by the indirect method and also confirm that the optimal cruising speed is the same over multiple sections.</p>",

This inaccuracy in planning principles can lead to infeasible timetables, which induce delays and thus reduce the service reliability of railway transport. The objective of this paper is to support the design of fact-based timetables by introducing a systematic analysis of historical data from operations on the Danish railway, which includes testing the principles used in the timetable design, specifically regarding the allocation of headway time, and identifying possible improvements to the scheduling of trains according to their specific characteristics. The data records used in this analysis are generated by the signaling system and the automatic train detection system. The records state the scheduled and realized times of each train at every timing point on the network, as well as, categorical information about the trains and the measuring points. The timestamps are rearranged by an automatic algorithm to calculate the scheduled and realized running times, the scheduled and realized headways at the timing points, and the change in deviation between consecutive timing points for each train run. The relationships between these factors are then analyzed statistically to identify the adjustments that can be made to the timetabling principles to reduce the generation of secondary delays in operation and to improve the possibility of delay recovery under disturbed operation.</p>",

We study the case where commercial trains and publicly controlled traffic (\u201ccommuter trains\u201d) use the same railway infrastructure and hence compete for capacity. We develop a method that can be used by an infrastructure manager trying to allocate capacity in a socially efficient way. The method calculates the loss of social benefits incurred by changing the commuter train timetable to accommodate a commercial train path request and based on this calculates a reservation price for the train path request. If the commercial operator\u2019s willingness-to-pay for the train path exceeds the loss of social benefits, its request is approved. The calculation of social benefits takes into account changes in commuter train passengers\u2019 travel times, waiting times, transfers and crowding, and changes in operating costs for the commuter train operator(s). The method is implemented in a microscopic simulation program, which makes it possible to test the robustness and feasibility of timetable alternatives.<br/>\nWe show that the method is possible to apply in practice by demonstrating it in a case study from Stockholm, illustrating the magnitudes of the resulting commercial train path prices. We conclude that marginal societal costs of railway capacity in Stockholm are considerably higher than the current track access charges.</span></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"> </span></span></p>",

This paper analyses timetable quality from the perspective of the Swedish infrastructure manager, i.e. from the perspective of an infrastructure manager operating in a deregulated market. Seven categories of timetable quality are discussed: feasibility, disturbance resistance, competition management, capacity safeguarding, application fulfilment, attractiveness and compatibility with surrounding planning areas. Each category is introduced, including references to legal documents, current development projects and research literature. Further, an interview study with eight practitioners gives insight into the current state of practice in Sweden. The practitioners consider feasibility to be both most important and easiest to handle. Capacity guarding is considered least important, despite its prevalence in legal documents and envisioned process developments, and is also considered hardest to handle. The lack of published guidelines was repeatedly mentioned as an explanation to why capacity guarding is not considered during timetable construction. In general, formal rules and guidelines seem important for supporting the timetable planners in their arbitrating role, and improved timetable planning tools would also be beneficial for resolving e.g. problems with maintenance possession planning. The results show that there is a gap between the wanted state as depicted by legal documents and development projects, and the current state of practice in Sweden. Operational research can contribute to closing this gap, both by constructing formal guidelines and measurements for quality aspects, and by developing functionalities for timetable planning support tools.</p>",

The study is also a pilot on combining railway traffic data and maintenance data for analytical purposes. This type of analysis can show how different types of trackwork influence punctuality.\nPrevious studies on this subject have mainly utilised causes of delay data. In this study we have found methods to strengthen such analyses also by taking into account the high-resolution data available from registered records of train movements. The current study illustrates how such time data can be utilised in order to enhance the decision support system for maintenance.\n A data processing method is used to identify the affected lines. A search engine is designed in order to correlate the two datasets (including train traffic data and trackwork data) and to extract the required data for the analysis. Through the overlap between the duration of trackwork and the delay in departure time, it is demonstrated that it is possible to combine railway infrastructure data with train traffic data.\nAs a result of this analysis, it is discovered that for railway traffic, in general, trackwork contribute, in fact, to a minor part of all causes of delays. However, a relatively large share of the trackwork was related to train delays. Another important finding from this study is that, when trackwork are conducted, it is a high probability that they will cause delays in train schedules and these delays are relatively large too.</p>",

This track closure had severe effects on the railway freight and passenger transport. This work investigates the effects on the Swiss railroad network, using openly available realized operation data. The behavior of the delays before, during and after the disruption is investigated on three different levels. First, the delay of arriving trains to Basel SBB, as it can be seen as the input delay into the Swiss railway system. Secondly, it is investigated how the delay evolves on the Swiss intercity and interregional lines in short distance (i.e. first stop) and thirdly how this delay evolves over the course of the lines. The results display a consistent improvement of punctuality during the disruption period, which however decreases when considering stations farther away from Basel SBB. This can be explained by the fact that during the disruption period, trains arriving from Germany at Basel SBB exhibit, due to the shorter running distance, significantly lower delays than during other periods. The improved punctuality is therefore a result of a reduced delay propagation of the trains arriving from Germany. The effects of this severe and long lasting disruption can be quantified even in some spatial and temporal distance. It can be used as an example to test theoretical models, which forecast delays, or examine train network complexity and interconnectivity.</p>",

In this regard, there are usually buffer times allocated at (in) the station (section) in the train timetable, to recover delays. Most of the existing methods that deal with the buffer time allocation mainly consider the length of the section and the traffic density. These methods usually fail to consider the impact of the actual delay of trains, and the buffer time allocation (BTA) is unreasonable. The integration of the actual delay effects into the BTA needs to be resolved. Based on this, in this work, a delay time distribution model was established, and the models were compared according to the standard error of each parameter in the model. Subsequently, based on the delay distribution, a BTA model with weighted average delay expectation time as the objective function was constructed in which the weight coefficients were determined based on the delay strength, and the model was solved by a mathematical analysis method. Different allocation models were designed for different ranges of the total buffer time values. Finally, taking the Dutch railway network trunk section Maarssen\u2013Utrecht Centraal (Mas\u2013Ut) as an example, the results show that the buffer time after redistribution of the BTA model reduces the expected delay time in the segment by 5.25% compared with the original buffer time of the station, indicating that the BTA is reasonable.</p>",

Conventional administrative procedures are often based, explicitly or implicitly, on prioritising criteria, which make them insufficient to differentiate between competing operators with similar services. An allocation method that improves social welfare would be desirable, but calculating welfare requires information that is typically commercially sensitive, such as number of passengers, fares and cost structures, making such an approach difficult to implement.</p>\n<p>This paper describes the respective virtues and challenges of different types of allocation methods in the context of a deregulated market with mixed traffic and government-owned tracks. Three broad groups of allocation methods are described: commercial traffic with long planning horizons, traffic organised by public traffic agencies, and short-term traffic.</p>\n<p>We then outline an allocation method that better meets the requirements of a deregulated market. It is a mixed method, which uses an auction-like mechanism to allocate pre-defined paths to commercial operators on specified, capacity-constrained lines. The value of capacity for non-commercial public transport is assessed through social cost-benefit analysis (social CBA) of timetables. These social CBA results then decide the access charges for commercial operators.</p>",

Different levels of timetables will be discussed and further developed. Two concepts, slots and pulses, are described together with precondition and modelling to accomplish a mixed timetable level for flexible freight traffic and fixed passenger traffic. Finally, a comparison of the timetable levels with the rail freight corridor Rhine-Alpine is presented. In conclusion, three points for further research are made, and an experiment is suggested to validate the result in the future.</p>",

Specifically, we examined arrival and departure delay duration distributions and used heatmaps to demonstrate the spatiotemporal frequency distribution of delays, delay increases, and delay recovery, and the heatmaps clearly show hot spots (coordinates with high frequencies) in a timetable. Then, we separated delays as discrete intervals according to their severity, and analyzed the delay increasing frequency and the delay increasing severity within each interval, so as to clarify the relationships of delay increasing probability and delay increasing severity with delay extents. Next, we investigated the observed delay recoveries and prescheduled buffer times at (in) station (section), which demonstrate the recovery ability of each station and section. Finally, to understand the key influencing factor of delay propagation, we analyzed the relationship between capacity utilization and delays, delay increases, and delay recoveries, by examining their Pearson correlation coefficients. These indicate that delay frequencies and delay increasing frequencies with Pearson correlation coefficients as high as 0.9 are highly dependent on capacity utilization. The uncovered delay propagation patterns can enrich dispatchers\u2019 experience, and improve their decision-making ability during real-time dispatching in HSR.</p>",

The tolerable coefficient which is the ratio of passengers\u2019 tolerable travel time and shortest travel time of all connected paths is proposed and added to evaluation indicators to reflect passengers\u2019 choice behaviour of travel paths. Based on the maximum impact of passengers, ratio of affected passenger volume (RPV) is proposed to identify the important stations. The AFC data, train running time data are used to calculate the passenger volume and passengers\u2019 tolerable travel paths in Wuhan subway. Finally, the connectivity reliability of Wuhan subway network is analysed through simulate attack stations. The results show that the identification methods of Degree Centrality (DC), Betweenness Centrality (BC) and ratio of affected passenger volume (RPV) can effectively identify the important stations on connectivity reliability of Wuhan subway. In particular, the method of RPV can identify the important stations that can influence the passengers\u2019 travel realization in URT network most. In addition, attacking stations has greater impact on the passengers\u2019 travel paths choice than passengers\u2019 travel efficiency and travel realization.</p>",

This paper deals with timetable rescheduling during such disruptions, particularly in the case where all tracks between two stations are blocked for a few hours. In practice, the disruption length is uncertain, and a disruption may become shorter or longer than predicted. Thus, it is necessary to take the uncertainty of the disruption duration into account. This paper formulates the robust timetable rescheduling as a rolling horizon two-stage stochastic programming problem in deterministic equivalent form. The random disruption duration is assumed to have a finite number of possible realizations, called scenarios, with given probabilities. Every time a prediction about the range of the disruption end time is updated, new scenarios are defined, and the model computes the optimal rescheduling solution for an extended control horizon, which is robust to all these scenarios. Based on the model, uncertain disruptions can be handled with robust solutions in a dynamic environment. The stochastic method was tested on a part of the Dutch railways, and compared to a deterministic rolling-horizon method. The results showed that compared to the deterministic method, the stochastic method is more likely to generate better rescheduling solutions for uncertain disruptions by less train cancellations and/or delays, while the solution robustness can be affected by the predicted range regarding the disruption end time.</p>",

The capacity at an EMUs depot is relevant to its track utilization rate, which can be improved by a better shunting operation plan. An EMUs depot  typically consists of a maintenance yard, washing yard and temporary storage yard. Each track in those yard has two sections, and can be occupied by a long EMU or two separate short EMUs. The two yard types, stub-end and through, further add complexity to the shunting operation problem. Compared to the previous researches, the shunting operation plan studied in this paper takes the yard types and the section assignment into account simultaneously. An optimization model was established aims to minimize the total delay time of EMU in running shed during the plan horizon. The constraints include the numbers of operation tracks and EMUs, operation sequence and the dwell time of operation tracks, etc. The original problem is transformed into a typical job shop scheduling problem with additional space and time constraints. Then a hybrid heuristic algorithm based on Tube Search is designed to solve the model. Finally, by taking a real-world EMU depot as an example, the numerical results show that the proposed solution method can yield an assignment plan with the optimal track utilization in a small amount of computational time and can be implemented in a computer-aided planning system easily.</p>",

We present a new formulation of the rtRTMP. This new formulation is based on a previously proposed one that models railway traffic at a microscopic level with optional activities using a Constraint Based Scheduling (CBS) approach. To ease the modelling of optional activities, a new concept based on a tree data structure and a specific filtering algorithm was extended by the introduction of conditional time-interval variables in CP Optimizer library. The new formulation of the rtRTMP presented in this paper exploits the conditional time-interval variables. The formulation has been validated with experiments on a large set of instances. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new CBS model and show good performance of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the art RECIFE-MILP algorithm.</p>",

In order to take into account all relevant aspects in terms of environmental impacts of a railway passenger service, a holistic system perspective is required, that includes a whole life cycle assessment. A life cycle approach is important since comparison of for instance only the exhaust emissions of an electric vehicle with a petrol vehicle is misleading, due to neglecting the emissions of for instance electrical energy production process. Thus, all stages in energy carrier, vehicle and infrastructure life cycles are to be considered. Existing models are analyzed, as well as possible developments, focusing on diesel and electrical traction as the most common traction options in use, and on GHG emissions, especially on CO2, which takes the greatest part in all emissions. Issues and challenges in improving the environmental impact of railway passenger services are addressed. Additionally, several areas are indicated where environmental aspects could be included in future assessment models. The main challenge is answering how the existing partial assessments can be brought together and, together with filling the identified gaps, allow to conduct a comprehensive LCA which will produce real-world emissions estimations. Results of this paper will be used as an input in developing a framework for quantifying and improving overall environmental impacts of a railway passenger service.</p>",

In past decades, the most famous type of seat inventory control policy was partitioned booking limit control (PBLC), which was extensively applied by railway companies but observed to be inefficient for stochastic demand. In recent years, China Railway Corporation attempted to overcome this deficiency by applying a new type of seat inventory control policy, denoted \u201cseat-based control\u201d. Seat-based control provides a more flexible way to manage resources but has encountered difficulty in setting the initialization parameters. This study focuses on the parameter setting problem for seat-based control considering i) the randomness of customer arrival, ii) the customer choice behavior and iii) the specifics of China Railway Corporation. A Markovian decision process (MDP) model is built, and a genetic algorithm method with a special structure is designed. The performance of the seat-based control is tested in two experiments with two other benchmarks. Finally, we apply our method to practical data of the Nanning-Guangzhou high-speed railway line.</p>",

To maintain a high quality in railway traffic it is important that the timetables are robust and there is a need for strategies and rules for how to make them robust without consuming too much capacity. In this paper we present how timetable rules can be implemented manually to create more robust timetables. The rules are separated into two categories, rules to make the timetable feasible and rules to increase the delay resistance and recovery. The implementation is illustrated in a real-world case from when the timetable for the Swedish Southern mainline was created for 2019. In the paper we describe how new rules can be applied manually and discuss advantages and disadvantages by using this approach. We also describe how the rules effect the trains, their timetable slots and runtimes. The results from this study show some of the difficulties when moving from theory to practice and what can be done with limited resources in reality. It gives insights to the practical approach of train timetabling problem which can be used to improve optimization models.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Disruptions in urban rail transit systems usually result in serious incidents because of the high density and the less flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical model for handling a complete blockage of the double tracks for 5-10 minutes in the peak hours, e.g., lack of power at a station, no train can pass this area during the disruption. Under this operating scenario, train services may be delayed or cancelled, some rolling stocks may be short-turned at the intermediate stations with either single or double crossovers. To ensure the service quality provided to passengers, the backup rolling stocks inside the depot may also be put into the operation depending on the consequences of the disruptions. Thus, the number of rolling stocks in the depot is considered. We discuss the disruption management problem for urban rail transit systems at a macroscopic level. However, operational constraints for the turnaround operation of rolling stocks and for the rolling stock circulation are modelled. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to minimize the train delays and the number of canceled train services as well as to ensure a regular service for passengers, while adhering to the departure and arrival constraints, headway constraints, turnaround constraints, service connection constraints, inventory constraints, and other relevant railway constraints. Existing MILP solvers, e.g. CPLEX, are adopted to compute near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments are conducted based on real-world data generated for Beijing subway line 7 to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.</p>",

As a result, the costs of compensation to operators for service disruption and revenue loss have been increasing in line with traffic levels. There tends to be a trade-off between the cost efficiency of engineering activities and the compensation costs for the operational disruption caused, since longer track possessions are typically more efficient, but also more disruptive, reducing network availability for operations. There is thus a need to reduce and, ideally, minimise the total costs of engineering activities and compensation for the disruption caused. The current possession planning process does not actively aim to minimise service disruption and compensation costs, much less the combined engineering and compensation costs. A further, detailed review of the current possession planning process, including data availability and needs, is being undertaken, and, together with the results of recent research, will be applied to (i) amend the current possession planning process to  reduce its disruptive impact and compensation costs, thus increasing network availability for operations, and (ii) to identify data requirements to enable the assessment of duration, engineering costs and timetable impacts/compensation costs associated with alternative possession strategies, and apply these in combination with scheduling techniques to reduce and, ideally, minimise combined engineering and compensation costs.</p>",

Railway rescheduling is a complex problem to solve both from a practical and a computational perspective. Problems of practically relevant sizes have typically a very large search space, making it a challenge to arrive at the best possible solution within the available computational time limit. Though competitive algorithmic approaches are a widespread topic of research, not much research has been done to explore the opportunities and challenges in parallelizing them on Graphics processing units (GPUs). This paper presents a conflict detection module for railway rescheduling, which performs its computations on the GPU. The aim of the module is to improve the speed of solution space navigation and thus the solution quality within the computational time limit. The implemented algorithm proved to be more than twice as fast as the sequential algorithm. We conclude that for the problem under consideration,\nusing a GPU for conflict detection likely gives rise to better solutions at the end of the computational time limit.</p>",

The train plan for a carload freight railway network determines how railcars are sorted into blocks by common destination and transported on trains between yards.  To deliver competitive service to freight shippers, practitioners must devise an optimal plan that balances mainline and yard efficiencies while dealing with variation in both train arrival times and inbound traffic volumes. Despite the important role of both mainlines and yard facilities in freight rail transportation performance, little attention is devoted to investigations of classification yard performance, and there are few yard capacity models and tools.  To address this railway industry need, the research in this paper seeks to investigate the influence of inbound traffic volume variation and schedule flexibility on classification yard performance and capacity.  A series of simulation experiments quantify the interaction between arrival time and volume variability as measured by different yard performance metrics. The simulations are conducted with a discrete-event simulation model developed specifically for analysis of hump classification yards.  Preliminary results suggest that increasing schedule flexibility causes classification yard performance to decline.  Increasing volume variability appears to have a less pronounced effect.  The results of the research will allow railroads to make more informed business decisions regarding train operating plans and make more efficient and economical use of existing yard capacity.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Railway operation companies provide a more efficient and sustainable service for passengers, so that they can have a stronger competitiveness in the multimodal transportation market. However, in daily railway operation, inevitably unplanned events occur several times per year such as rolling stock break-down, which may influence train running time, as well as arrival and departure time. Under severe disruptions, stop patterns of trains may be changed, even cancelling or inserting certain trains may be taken by dispatchers. Train rescheduling will be quite different and challenging in a railway system with ticket booking mechanism compared with non-reserved mechanism. This paper develops an mixed-integer programing model for the problem of train rescheduling with passenger reassignment on a railway network with ticket booking mechanism under severe disruptions. Passenger reassignment will be taken into consideration to ensure that as many as passengers effected by disruptions may arrive at their destinations as early as possible. The function objective is to maximize transported passengers of cancelled trains, and minimize total delay time of trains at their destination stations, with consideration of planning extra stops for unaffected trains to transport more passengers effected to their planned destinations, seat capacity limitation and uncertainty of disruptions. A constraint will be set to ensure that the same number of passengers are assigned to the same following train(s) under different random disruption scenarios, which imposes the robustness of dispatching. There will be several numerical experiments based on \u201cBeijing-Shanghai\u201d High Speed Railway Line to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our model.</p>",

Much of this freight moves in trains that depart yards when a certain number of railcars are ready to be moved, and not according to a pre-planned timetable. Recent North American industry trends have seen a move away from these flexible operations to more structured operations where trains depart yards at specific times according to a train plan. This research investigates how operating strategies at classification yards and schedule flexibility of mainline trains combine to affect the average railcar transit time from origin to destination across a representative rail network. Experiments comparing different yard operating strategies under varying degrees of schedule flexibility were conducted using SIGMA simulation software. Simulation results suggest that railcar transit time increases as the level of schedule flexibility increases under all three of the studied operating strategies. Several factors, including the timing and distribution of railcars on inbound trains arriving at the yard, and frequency of outbound train departures, influence the sensitivity of transit time to schedule flexibility under different operating strategies. There is no universal best strategy to minimize railcar transit times; different traffic scenarios require different operating solutions. This research may help railway practitioners develop more effective operating strategies to improve carload freight operations and performance, and influence decisions on yard operations and train assembly planning.</p>",
